# The DIY Machine Learning Engineer Masters

I'm Alistair - a Manager and Machine Learning Engineer at EY - based in Melbourne, Australia. Since 2017, I have a Bachelor in Computer Science and have dabbled in a Master of Data Science program, various online courses and books, as I continue to follow my passion of working with data and code. 

For financial and work reasons, I decided to end my university learning in late 2018. Instead, I am now enjoying the freedom and variety afforded from building and executing on a "DIY" masters (of sorts). The following list details my very own "DIY Machine Learning Engineer Masters". This masters is designed based on job descriptions from some of the most prominent tech companies, trials of various online courses and recommended books and lists across the web.

I hope this may give you courage to tackle a self-curated masters of your own as you embark on a journey of learning. 

## What is a Machine Learning Engineer?

*"As a Data Analyst, you’re analyzing data in order to tell a story, and to produce actionable insights for members of your team. The analysis is performed and presented by human beings, to other human beings who may then go on to make business decisions based on what’s been presented. The “audience” for your output is human. As a Machine Learning engineer, on the other hand, your final “output” is working software (not the analyses or visualizations that you may have to create along the way), and your “audience” for this output often consists of other software components that run autonomously with minimal human supervision."*

## Curriculum

I've extended the [Data Science Venn Diagram (by Drew Conway)](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) to cover a set of domains that I feel give adequate coverage of the fundamentals required to be a strong Machine Learning Engineer.
